      <p>
        Hi I'm Charlie. I'm a rock climber. I spent some time in Canada. I've
        been learning react in my own time. I've got lots of retail experience

          <p class="project__description">
            This app fetches data from the twitter API to display the recent
            tweets made about Norm Macdonald, as a tribute to the late comedian.
            During the process, I encountered a CORS issue for the first time.
            To solve the issue, I served the React app from an express server;
            allowing the server to make the API request. Through the building of
            Norm, I discovered Express, Node, CORS, working with an external
            API, and page-designing.

          <p class="project__description">
            This drink tracking app was the result of a casual pub chat, where
            we discovered that it was difficult to track rounds with mates. The
            app allows users to enter their name, date, and the quantity of
            their purchased drink, where users are also able to access their
            rounds history.

            This application is intended to replace several google sheets that
            are used to coordinate tasks and feed information to and from
            multiple users to the online order fulfilment team. I am also taking
            this opportunity to learn more about the MERN stack to deepen my
            understanding in order to support an upcoming volunteer project with
            Code.Sydney starting in January 2021.
